# MediaFoundation
MediaFoundation Headers for Delphi and FPC.
DirectX Video Acceleration Headers are also included (both DXVA and DXVA2).

This are the header translations of SDK Version 10.0.10240.0.
You will also need the DX12.DXGI.pas from my DirectX 12 Header translation.

The SDK Sample "SimplePlay" is also included in a Delphi and FPC Version.
